This repository contains the code for the Similarity Encoder (SimEc) neural network model (and others). To get an overview, first check out the iPython notebook at `examples_simec.ipynb`. 
Further information and theoretical background can be found in the accompanying [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01824).

dependencies: (main code) numpy, theano; (experiments) scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, [nlputils](https://github.com/cod3licious/nlputils)

### main code
- `ann.py` contains basic theano code to generate a neural network with multiple layers (see also the [theano tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/index.html)).
- `ann_models.py` builds upon `ann.py` to create a neural network model, which can be used to solve supervised ML tasks like classification or regression with a similar interface as sklearn classifiers.
- `similarity_encoder.py` contains the SimilarityEncoder class to set up, train, and apply the similarity encoder; by default it sets up a linear SimEc, i.e. with one linear layer to project the high dimensional data to a low dimensional embedding, and another layer to compute the output, the approximated similarities. Depending on the target similarities that should be preserved in the embedding space, more complex (i.e. deeper) models should be used (see also the notebook with examples).

### experiments
- `ann_test.py` contains some exemplary classification and regression problems to test the `ann_models` neural networks.
- `utils.py` contains some helper functions mostly to load datasets and plot results used by `examples_simec.ipynb`.
- `examples_simec.ipynb` is an iPython notebook with multiple examples showing embeddings of image and text datasets created using standard dimensionality reduction algorithms (kPCA, Isomap, ...) as well as Similarity Encoder models with different network architectures, cost functions, etc.
